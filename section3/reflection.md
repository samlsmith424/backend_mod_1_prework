## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * I really like the acronym SMART in regards to setting goals
    * Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound
  * With programming, mistakes are unavoidable and are part of the learning process.   

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I currently demonstrate a growth mindset because I can reflect on the process and focus on what worked and didn't work.
  * The way I do not have a growth mindset is that I tend to stray away from asking for help or asking questions.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash in an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Hashes are indexed by keys of any object type.  
Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
pet_store = {
  'dog kibble types'=> 8,
  'cat_kibble_types' => 7,
  'dog toys' => 48,
  'cat nip' => 6,
  'litter boxes' => 20
}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
puts states['IA']

```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```
puts states.keys
puts states.values

```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

A hash is helpful when making an inventory. If I want to categorize items in my closet, a hash is preferred.
It enables me to create an unordered list, assign keys, and have multiple sets of organized components.  

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I will need to keep practicing them in order to form muscle memory for the correct syntax.
