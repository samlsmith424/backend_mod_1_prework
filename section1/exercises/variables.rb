# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name
my_name = "Sam Smith"
puts my_name
# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
# YOUR CODE HERE
x = 'Dobby'
puts x

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
# YOUR CODE HERE
y = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts y

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students
puts "#{students + 2}"

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students
puts "#{students - 2}"


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Henry"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1

puts "#{first_name}"
puts "#{is_hungry}"
puts "#{number_of_pets}"

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain.

# I decided by comtemplating how the values would best work in a sentence
# while keeping the values true to intent to the variables.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Fido"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 3

puts "#{first_name}"
puts "#{is_hungry}"
puts "#{number_of_pets}"

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "The total number of snacks is #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}."

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
  # Yes I ran the file in the terminal and everything ran as expected.
